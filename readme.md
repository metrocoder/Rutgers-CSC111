Objective
The aim of CS111 is to introduce the student to the fundamental techniques used in computer science and
software development. Upon completion of this course, the successful student should be able to design,
write, test, and analyze programs to solve simple real-world problems.
CS111 uses the Java programming language, but it is not a training course in Java. Many Java features, such as
applets, GUI programming, Java Server Pages (JSP), etc., are not covered in this course.
