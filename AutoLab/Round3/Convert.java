/*Write your code in the file Convert.java. Your code should go into a method with the following signature. You may write your own main method to test your code. The graders will ignore your main method:
 *
 * public static int convert (String binaryString, boolean signBit){}
 *
 *
 * In the beginning of the class you were taught an algorithm for converting binary strings to their decimal integer equivelant.
 *
 * The sign bit is as follows: true for signed integer, false for unsigned integer. For a signed integer, the most significant bit is the leftmost bit, with 0 for positive and 1 for negative.
